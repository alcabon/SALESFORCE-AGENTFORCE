# Comprehensive Study: Salesforce External Objects

## Executive Summary

Salesforce external objects represent a powerful data integration solution that enables real-time access to external data sources without storing data within Salesforce. Through Salesforce Connect, organizations can access and manipulate external data as if it were native to the Salesforce platform, providing significant advantages for modern data integration scenarios while introducing unique limitations and implementation considerations.

## 1. External Objects Overview

### Definition and Purpose

External objects are special Salesforce objects that **map to data stored outside your Salesforce org**. Unlike standard or custom objects where data resides within Salesforce, external objects create a virtual connection to external data sources, allowing users to interact with external data through familiar Salesforce interfaces.

**Key characteristics:**
- **API naming convention**: External objects use the suffix `__x` (instead of `__c` for custom objects)
- **Real-time access**: Data is retrieved in real-time through web service callouts
- **No data storage**: External objects maintain metadata mappings only, not actual data
- **Org limits**: Each org can have up to 200 external objects (separate from custom object limits)

### Technical Architecture

**Core components:**
- **External Data Source**: Defines connection configuration, authentication settings, and API endpoints
- **External Objects**: Map to tables or entities in external systems with field definitions
- **Salesforce Connect Engine**: Translates SOQL queries into external system queries and handles authentication

**Data flow process:**
1. **Query Translation**: Salesforce Connect translates SOQL queries into appropriate format for external systems
2. **Real-time Callouts**: HTTP requests made to external endpoints to retrieve data
3. **ID Mapping**: Salesforce creates temporary IDs for external records and maps them to external system IDs
4. **Data Presentation**: External data rendered in standard Salesforce interfaces

### Supported Adapters

**OData Adapters:**
- **OData 4.01**: Latest version with no callout limits (recommended)
- **OData 4.0**: Legacy version with callout limitations
- **OData 2.0**: Deprecated version (avoid for new implementations)

**SQL Adapters:**
- **Snowflake**: Access to Snowflake data warehouses via SQL API
- **Amazon Athena**: Query data in Amazon S3 using SQL

**Specialized Adapters:**
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: High-scale NoSQL data access
- **GraphQL**: Access to GraphQL APIs (including Amazon RDS via AWS AppSync)
- **Cross-Org Adapter**: Connect to other Salesforce orgs
- **Custom Apex Adapter**: Developer-built adapters for any REST API

### Key Use Cases

**Primary business scenarios:**
- **ERP Integration**: Access order management data from SAP, Oracle, or other ERP systems
- **Data Warehouse Integration**: Connect to historical data in systems like Snowflake or Amazon Athena
- **Legacy System Integration**: Connect to on-premises databases through OData wrappers
- **Multi-Org Scenarios**: Share data between different Salesforce orgs

**Real-world example:**
```
Customer Service Enhancement:
- Support agents need access to billing history stored in external systems
- External objects map to billing system tables
- Agents view payment history alongside case information
- Eliminates context switching between systems
```

## 5. Record Access Policies

### Security Architecture

External objects operate under a **simplified security model** compared to standard Salesforce objects:
- **Object-level security**: Available through profiles and permission sets
- **Field-level security**: Supported similar to standard objects
- **Limited record-level security**: Traditional sharing rules NOT supported
- **Restriction rules**: Available since Summer '22 release (limited functionality)

### User Permissions and Access Control

**Object-level permissions:**
```
Permission Sets (Recommended):
- Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) permissions
- View All and Modify All permissions
- Assignable to multiple users
- Packageable and upgradeable

Profile-Based Permissions:
- Same CRUD permissions available
- Less flexible than permission sets
- Single profile per user limitation
```

**Field-level security implementation:**
```
Permission Set: External_Data_Access
- External_Customer__x: Read, Create, Update
- Fields: 
  - Name: Visible, Editable
  - SSN: Hidden for standard users
  - Salary: Visible but Read-only
```

### Authentication Requirements

**Named Credentials and External Credentials (Current Best Practice):**
```
External Credential: "External_System_Auth"
- Authentication Protocol: OAuth 2.0
- Custom Parameters: 
  - client_id: [secured]
  - client_secret: [secured]

Named Credential: "External_System_Connection"
- URL: https://api.external-system.com
- External Credential: External_System_Auth
- Generate Authorization Header: Yes
```

**Authentication types:**
1. **Named Principal**: Org-wide authentication
2. **Per-User Authentication**: Individual user credentials
3. **Custom Authentication**: API keys, tokens, custom headers

### Sharing Rules and Restrictions

**NOT available for external objects:**
- Organization-wide defaults
- Role hierarchy sharing
- Criteria-based sharing rules
- Owner-based sharing rules
- Manual sharing
- Apex-managed sharing

**Alternative security approaches:**
- **External system security**: Implement row-level security in external database
- **Per-user authentication**: Configure external system authentication per user
- **Restriction rules**: Filter visible records based on user criteria (limited to equality comparisons)

**Restriction rules example:**
```
Rule Name: Regional_Access_Control
User Criteria: User.Region__c = 'APAC'
Record Criteria: External_Customer__x.Region__c = 'APAC'
```

## 6. Implementation Considerations

### Setup Requirements

**Prerequisites:**
- **Salesforce Connect License**: Required for all users accessing external objects
- **Supported Editions**: Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions
- **API Version**: Minimum API version 32.0 required
- **External System Compatibility**: Must support REST APIs or OData protocols
- **HTTPS**: All external connections should use HTTPS for security

### Configuration Best Practices

**Step-by-step setup process:**
1. **Enable Salesforce Connect**: Setup → Salesforce Connect → Follow activation steps
2. **Create External Data Source**: Setup → External Data Sources → New External Data Source
3. **Configure connection parameters**: URL, authentication, and named credentials
4. **Validate and Sync**: Use "Validate and Sync" to retrieve schema from external system
5. **Create external objects**: Select tables/views to synchronize

**Example OData configuration:**
```
External Data Source: OrderDB
Type: Salesforce Connect: OData 4.01
URL: https://orderdb.company.com/orders.svc
Authentication: OAuth via Named Credential
```

### Performance Optimization

**Data retrieval optimization:**
- **Selective syncing**: Only sync necessary data and fields
- **Indexing**: Ensure external data source is properly indexed
- **Query optimization**: Write efficient SOQL queries with appropriate WHERE clauses
- **Server-driven pagination**: Recommended for large collections

**Query best practices:**
```sql
// Good - Selective query with WHERE clause
SELECT Id, Name, External_Status__c 
FROM External_Order__x 
WHERE CreatedDate = TODAY 
LIMIT 100

// Avoid - Unfiltered query
SELECT Id, Name FROM External_Order__x
```

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Design pitfalls:**
- **Over-syncing data**: Syncing unnecessary fields or entire tables
- **Ignoring governor limits**: Not planning for API call limits
- **Poor index strategy**: Not optimizing external database indexes
- **Complex joins**: Exceeding the 4-join limit in SOQL queries

**Security oversights:**
- **Hardcoded credentials**: Never store credentials in plain text
- **Insufficient access controls**: Not implementing proper user permissions
- **Unencrypted connections**: Using HTTP instead of HTTPS
- **Overprivileged access**: Granting unnecessary permissions

### Troubleshooting Guidance

**Common connection issues:**
- **External data source validation fails**: Verify URL accessibility, check authentication credentials, ensure network connectivity
- **"Invalid OAuth Token" errors**: Refresh OAuth credentials, check token expiration, verify scope permissions

**Data access problems:**
- **External objects not appearing**: Verify deployment status, check user permissions, ensure proper field-level security
- **Reports showing incomplete data**: Review report filters, check external system availability, verify query performance

**Performance issues:**
- **Slow query response**: Optimize external database indexes, implement selective queries, use appropriate WHERE clauses
- **API limit exceeded**: Monitor usage patterns, implement retry logic, optimize query frequency

### Custom Apex Adapter Example

```apex
global class CustomDataSourceProvider extends DataSource.Provider {
    global override List<DataSource.AuthenticationCapability> getAuthenticationCapabilities() {
        return new List<DataSource.AuthenticationCapability>{
            DataSource.AuthenticationCapability.OAUTH
        };
    }
    
    global override List<DataSource.Capability> getCapabilities() {
        return new List<DataSource.Capability>{
            DataSource.Capability.ROW_QUERY,
            DataSource.Capability.SEARCH
        };
    }
    
    global override DataSource.Connection getConnection(
        DataSource.ConnectionParams connectionParams) {
        return new CustomDataSourceConnection(connectionParams);
    }
}
```
